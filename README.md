# Event sourcing implementation in .NET microservices

This article will cover Event-Sourcing architecture in .NET 7 and almost everything required for developing services, such as a database for events. EventStoreDB will be used to store events and publish them to the message broker, among other things. The scenario will be kept simple to enhance understanding. Therefore, this article aims to clarify the differences between two keywords in the software engineering industry: Event-sourcing and event-driven.

Like previous articles, the first section provides a simple explanation of definitions and differences in the basic structure and requirements for implementation. Then, Event-sourcing will be implemented using EventStoreDB, and based on the CQRS, events will be separated from each other and prepared for publishing to the message broker.
